  abstract = {Introduction: Despite continuing efforts to promote skilled institutional delivery, eight women die 
  every hour in India due to causes related to pregnancy and child birth. The objectives of this study were to 
  assess the prevalence and the determinants of institutional delivery by skilled birth attendants in a rural 
  population in Andhra Pradesh, India. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from 'Young Lives', a 
  longitudinal study on childhood poverty, and the study population was a cohort of 1419 rural, economically 
  deprived women (from the Young Lives study) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The data are from round-1 of Young Lives 
  younger cohort recruited in 2002 and followed until 2015. The participation rate of households was 99.5{\%}. 
  Results: Prevalence of skilled institutional delivery was 36.8{\%}. Women's education (odds ratio [OR] for 
  secondary education 2.06; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%}CI] 1.33-3.19), desire to be pregnant (OR 1.89; 
  95{\%} CI 1.12-3.22) and adequate prenatal care (OR 1.69; 95{\%} CI 1.30-2.21) were found to be the positive 
  determinants of skilled institutional delivery. High birth order (OR for second birth 0.44; 95{\%} CI 0.32-0.60, 
  OR for third birth 0.47; 95{\%} CI 0.30-0.72 and OR for Efourth 0.47; 95{\%} CI 0.27-0.81), schedule caste
  /schedule tribe social background (OR 0.70; 95{\%} CI 0.53-0.93) and poor economic status of the household (OR 
  for the poorest households 0.67; 95{\%} CI 0.46-0.99) were negatively associated with skilled institutional 
  delivery.Conclusions: Despite existence of supporting schemes, the utilisation of skilled institutional delivery 
  services was low in the study population. Educated women and women with adequate prenatal care who have a desired
  pregnancy were more likely to utilise health institutions and skilled delivery care. There is a need for 
  integrated approaches through maternal health, family planning and education programs, and a focus on uneducated,
  poor women belonging to disadvantaged social groups{\textcopyright}M Nair, P Ariana, P Webster, 2012.},
