Research in this area examines how Amartya Sen's capability approach can be applied to health. We investigate how such an approach alters perception of the problem and aids in the development of viable and sustainable solutions. This work is undertaken in collaboration with the [Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)](https://www.ophi.org.uk).
